This could be usefully to avoid losing something valuable on your workmail after leaving the company or having a backup in case gmail locks you out.</li><li>Privacy, it wont download images (or other resources such as fonts) by default unless told to do so, this will block tackers and avoid the sender knowing that you have opened the mail. Cons:</li><li>The UI is not great, it is really hard and unintuitive to find the actions that you need. They are never where you expect them to be.</li><li>The tooling, filters, search. feels pretty poor, you can hit some limits when trying to do some advance stuff. F.ex you can manage to group your inbox by sender. This will be useful to quickly clean some over-spammed inbox. But you cant order the sender grouping by the number of mails that you have in each group, so you can\u2019t identify where are most of the useless mails.</li><li>Fragmented plugin ecosystem. AKA there are lots of plugins but most of them wont work on the recent big release.</li><li>Useless tab system. So you can have multiple inboxes, you can have tabs. I would make sense to have each inbox in one tab. No, there are all in the same unless you force it. Also in general tabs never behaves as expected.</li></ul><p>I am using the plugins:</p><ul><li><a href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/es/thunderbird/addon/thirdstats" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ThirdStats</a>. Dashboard with an overview of your mail usage.</li><li><a href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/es/thunderbird/addon/removedupes/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remove Duplicate Messages</a></li><li><a href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/es/thunderbird/addon/minimize-on-close/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minimize on Close</a>. This one should be a default that you can toggle on the options.</li><li><a href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/es/thunderbird/addon/full-address-column/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Full Address Colum</a>. For some reason this is not possible in thunderbird. If someone changes the name on their emails, you wont be able to neither know or group by the mail address by default.</li></ul><p>Todo:</p><ul><li>Backup</li></ul>',7),i=[s],c={},m="",p=o({__name:"20220806_mail",setup(l,{expose:e}){return e({frontmatter:{},excerpt:void 0}),(d,u)=>(a(),t("div",r,i))}});export{p as default,m as excerpt,c as frontmatter};
